## Overview

This is a modern React-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game. Built with React and Vite, this version leverages Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and TypeScript for a robust and interactive web-based experience.

- **1 Player**: Play against a computer-controlled opponent. You can choose the difficulty level for the computer opponent (Easy or Hard) based on your preference.
